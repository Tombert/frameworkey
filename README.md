Frameworkey
===========

A framework built around KoaJS

I noticed that there didn't seem to be any big cohesive MVC framework for
Koa...Let's fix that. 

What this Does
==============

Frameworkey provides easy wrapping for popular Koa/Node modules to give a
Rails/Play/Django-like experience for Koa development.
